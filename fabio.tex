\section{Introduction}

One obstacle when writing programs to analyse X-ray diffraction data or other
data collected from a two-dimensional detector is to read the raw data into the
program, not least because the data can be stored in many different formats
depending on the instrument used. 
We have had a similar problems and therefore decided to develop a general module, 
FabIO (FABle I/O), for easy reading of two-dimensional data. 
The module has been developed as part of the FABLE (Fully Automated BeamLine 
XXX) program suite for analysis of 3DXRD microscopy
data\cite{3dxrd}. The module is written in object-oriented scripting language
Python\cite{python} . Table \ref{format} shows the fairly comprehensive list of
file formats that Fabio can currently (ver. 0.1.0) read. FitAllB\cite{fitallb}.


\section{FabIO python module} 

\subsection{Philosophy}

The basic idea was to make a python module, which would enable very straight
forward reading of 2D diffraction  data images from any detector format
without having to worry about the format.
Therefore Fabio just needs a file name to open a file and make out the format. 
The data should be stored in memory as a standard 2D numpy array\cite{numpy}.
If the file contains image header information which should also be read and 
stored as a standard python dictionary. 
Furthermore there should be functions for reading the previous or next image 
in a series of images as well as jumping to a specific file number. 
For the user auxiliary functions should be independent of the image format.
The software should freely available to everyone and it should be modular in 
order to ensure the possibility for including other data formats. 
Fabio is licensed as GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) 
and the source code is freely available on-line\cite{fabio}.


\subsection{Implementation}

Generally Fabio have been code in Python\cite{python},
though for some image formats the python code is merely interfaced a reading 
layer programmed in standard C (sometimes using cython\cite{cython}.
Fabio makes use of the numerical python module numpy\cite{numpy} and there are
two optional python modules which can be used Lxml, for reading XML files
used in EDNA\cite{edna} and Python Image Library
\cite{pil}, for converting the image to be visualized in graphical user
interfaces based on the Python Tkinter library\cite{???} or simply with matplotlib\cite{matplotlib}. 
In the Python shell the FabIO module must be imported before reading an image of any of the supported formats, see Table \ref{format},  
this creates an instance of the python class {\em fabioimage} in this example called {\em img}.
This instance stores the image data, but also includes a number of methods.
im.data now has all the pixel values in the image stored as a numpy array. 
Often the image file contains furthermore information than just the intensities of the pixels, 
e.g. information about how the image is stored and the instrument parameters at the time of the image acquisition.
 Header information, if available, is available in im.header, which is
 a Python dictionary: 

\begin{verbatim}
> import fabio 								# import the fabio module 
> img = fabio.open(‘exampleimage0001.edf’) 	# Create a fabioimage instance from the file
> img.header 								# prints all headers from the file as a python dict.

> Fz1_motor_position = img.header[‘Fz1’] 	# retrieve an individual value from the header
>
> import pylab								# import pylab from matplotlib  
> pylab.imshow(img.data)					# display the data-array as an image
> pylab.show()								# 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{FabIO methods}

One the strengths of the implementation in an object oriented language as Python
is the possibility to ship functions (or methods) togeather with data. So in
addition to the header information and the image data, every fabioimage instance
(returned by fabio.open) provides methods which provide information about the image – minimum, maximum, mean values, 
methods which gives the file number, name etc. One of the most important method
is to read data from another image into the instance, these functions are next, previous, and getframe.
   

\subsection{Examples}
\begin{verbatim}
> import fabio 							
> im = fabio.open(’Quartz_0100.tif’)	# Open diffraction image file
> im.data								# Print image data (2D numpy array)								  
> im = im.next()						# Open next image
>  im = im.getframe(270)				# Jump to file number.
\end{verbatim}
